Esports, is a form of competition using video games. 
Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players, played individually or as teams. 
Multiplayer competitions were long a part of video game culture, but were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when the advent of online streaming media platforms, particularly YouTube and Twitch, enabled a surge in participation by professional gamers and spectators.
By the 2010s, esports was a major part of the video game industry, with many game developers designing for and funding for tournaments and other events.

<h2 class="header2">How did it become popular?</h2>
</div>

<div class="textbox2">
<p class="paragraph"> 
Esports first became popular in East Asia, particularly in China and South Korea (which first licensed professional players in 2000) but less so in Japan, whose broad anti-gambling laws prohibit professional gaming tournaments.
Esports are also popular in Europe and the Americas, which host regional and international events.
It also got popular due to the rise of streaming platforms and due to the support from game developers.
Esports began to receive coverage on traditional media platforms, and companies like Coca-Cola, Intel, and Red Bull started sponsoring events and teams.
And, in the early 2010s,  most viewers were between the ages of 18 and 34.

<h2 class="header3">Which games now lead esports?</h2>
</div>
    
<div class="textbox3">
<p class="paragraph">
A number of games are popular among professional competitors. 
The tournaments which emerged in the mid-1990s coincided with the popularity of fighting games and first-person shooters, genres which still maintain a devoted fan base. In the 2000s, real-time strategy games became overwhelmingly popular in South Korean internet cafés, with crucial influence on the development of esports worldwide. 
Competitions exist for many titles and genres, though the most popular games as of the early 2020s are Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Call of Duty, League of Legends, Dota 2, Fortnite, Rocket League, Valorant, Hearthstone, Super Smash Bros. Melee, StarCraft II and Overwatch. 
Hearthstone has also popularized the digital collectible card game (DCCG) genre since its release in 2014.
