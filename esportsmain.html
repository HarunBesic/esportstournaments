    <p class="paragraph1">Esports, short for electronic sports, is a form of competition using video games. 
Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players, played individually or as teams. 
Multiplayer competitions were long a part of video game culture, but were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when the advent of online streaming media platforms, particularly YouTube and Twitch, enabled a surge in participation by professional gamers and spectators.
By the 2010s, esports was a major part of the video game industry, with many game developers designing for and funding for tournaments and other events.
